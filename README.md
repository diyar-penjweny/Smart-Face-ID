Face Recognition Attendance System  

🌟 Overview  :
This project is a **face recognition-based attendance system** built with Python, OpenCV, and CustomTkinter. It automatically logs attendance using facial recognition technology!  

✨ Key Features  :
🔹 **Real-time face detection** using OpenCV's LBPH algorithm  
🔹 **Beautiful modern GUI** with dark/light mode 🌓  
🔹 **Easy registration** of new faces 📸  
🔹 **Smart attendance logging** with timestamps ⏰  
🔹 **Database management** for all records 📊  
🔹 **Export data** to CSV files 📁  

🛠️ Tech Stack  :
🐍 Python 3.7+  
🖼️ OpenCV (for face detection)  
🎨 CustomTkinter (for beautiful UI)  
🖼️ Pillow (for image processing)  

🚀 Quick Start  :
1️⃣ Install requirements:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python customtkinter pillow
